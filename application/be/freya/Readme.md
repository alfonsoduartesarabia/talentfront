# Freya 
Our backend web server

### Database
The database is configured inside of this repository using flyway migrations. They all sit ./src/main/resources/flyway/sql.
This is also where the docker-compose migrate service picks up the migrations, so changes to the database will all be done
in this service.

### Jooq
Freya makes the use of JOOQ to generate models of all of our database tables, and also as a way to query the database
inside of the application. All the files under ./src/main/java/models are all generated by Jooq, using the db migrations.

<br />If changes are made to the db migrations please run: `./gradlew generateJooq`

### Code Style
Before committing any code please run: `./gradlew spotlessApply`<br />This runs a script to format all the code in this
repository to make sure it meets our styleguide standards.

### Docker Build
1. ./gradlew clean build
