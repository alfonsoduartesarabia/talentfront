          <p>
            I am a SFSU computer science student who has little to no experience in the industry
            but is willing to learn the latest and popular technologies and can quickly adapt. I am
            most experience with Java and C and somewhat comfortable with C++. Hobbies include 
            listening to music and going for walks. I also enjoy consuming content whether it be
            on Youtube, Twitch, Netflix, etc.
            I hope to either become a software developer or get a Master's degree and become a teacher. </p>
