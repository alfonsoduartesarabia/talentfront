## Work to do
Everyone in the group for Milestone 0, has to make their own Page, which should follow a route from App.tsx and load their page which
should be in folder ./src/pages/{your_name}. You should learn how to route from the App.tsx to your page and your welcome to play with
css anyway you'd like on the page.

## Requirements
* Node
* NPM 
* Yarn (like NPM but built by facebook and its becoming industry standard)

## Running Locally

Information About running locally:

### `yarn install`

Before you can run any of the other yarn commands you have to install

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000/about](http://localhost:3000/about) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Notes:
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
